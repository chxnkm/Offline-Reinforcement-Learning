# Offline Reinforcement Learning
<b>URECA AY 21/22</b> 

This was a project undertaken in my second year in university, which allowed me to delve in-depth into the realm of 
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, specifically offline reinforcement learning. <br>

To summarize, <b>offline reinforcement learning</b> is a type of RL that solely uses a large fixed dataset
without any further addition. For example, this dataset could be distances of streets in a select few countries. 
The challenge arises from the key point that the agent has to learn from a limited pool of data, to generalize 
to any real-world condition it is thrown into. An example would be that with the limited dataset as mentioned above,
an autonomous driving agent must be able to adapt to streets of any country the car is sold in.<br>

I also seeked to understand the scalability of this novel algorithm into real-world situations, like in
medical surgeries and autonomous driving systems, to mention a few. I also make comparisons to D4RL, a collection of datasets
focused on research for offline RL.<br>
